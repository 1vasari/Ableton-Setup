# Ableton Setup

This repository contains the script files for my custom Ableton Live setup.

Please see [this Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/16h_llFn-s47aXnty1sprniB3rZckKB9ZNEPinA6k88U/edit?usp=sharing) to see what the keyboard layout looks like.

**Note**: this setup is customized for myself and myself only. Use at your own risk. Your milage may vary.

# Philisophy

The idea behind this setup is to emulate the idea behind the vim text editor and delegate as many common tasks as possible to the keyboard, rather than the mouse. Part of the way this is achieved is my using "modifier-less" key bindings where pressing a single key triggers an action (without using `Ctrl`, `Shift`, or `Alt`, etc). To this end, the entire keyboard has been filled up with bindings.

# Ideas

**Bindings not Thought About**

- Fold/unfold all tracks (Alt+clicking a fold button does this)
- Show fades
- Hide all automation lanes
- Follow transport

**Python API**

- Solo currently selected track
- Record arm currently selected track
- Mute currently selected track
